    "\"\"\"Ans: - A deque in Python, formally called a double-ended queue, is a specialized data structure from the collections\n",
    "module. It excels at efficiently adding and removing elements from both ends (front and back). This makes it ideal for\n",
    "scenarios where you frequently need to insert or remove data from either side.\n",

    "Deques behave similarly to lists in terms of indexing and iteration. You can access elements using square brackets and\n",
    "loop through them like any other sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can optionally set a fixed size for the deque using the maxlen parameter during creation. When the deque reaches\n",
    "its maximum capacity, adding a new element from one end automatically pops an element from the opposite end. This is\n",
    "useful for simulating a buffer or cache with a limited size.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main reasons to choose a deque over a regular Python list\n",
    "1. Performance enhancement\n",
    "Deques are framed for insertion and removal at both ends (front and back) with a time complexity of O(1). This makes them\n",

    "become sluggish for insertions at the beginning (O(n)) due to the need to shift elements down the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Functionality\n",
    "Deques offer some methods like appendleft and popleft specifically for adding and removing from the front, which aligns\n",

    "1. Stack of plates or books \n",
    "You can only add or remove plates or books from the top. This translates to how data is stored and accessed in a stack.\n",

    "Ans: - In Python, sets are a powerful data type that store collections of unique, unordered elements. The primary advantage\n",
    "of using sets in Python is their efficient membership testing. This means you can very quickly check if a specific element\n",

    "\n",
    "Here's why this makes sets so useful in specific problem-solving scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "Removing Duplicates\n",
    "Sets cannot contain duplicate elements. If you try to add a duplicate, it's simply ignored. This ensures each item appears\n",
    "only once. So, if you have a list with potential duplicates and want to obtain a unique collection of values, converting\n",
    "it to a set and then back to a list (like a new set) is a quick way to achieve this.\n",

    "Finding Common Elements (Intersection)\n",

    "for comparing sets of data and identifying overlaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding Unique Elements (Difference)\n",
